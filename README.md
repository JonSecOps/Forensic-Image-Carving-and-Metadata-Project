# Forensic-Image-Carving-and-Metadata-Project

**Project Summary:** 
This project involved forensic analysis of a 1GB USB thumb drive to uncover evidence linked to a suspected human trafficking case. By employing forensic tools like Scalpel, Foremost, and ImageMagick, critical files were carved, revealing a key JPG file with an MD5 hash that matched the suspect’s known image file. Analysis of EXIF data provided insights into the date, time, and location metadata, including latitude/longitude and the make/model of the camera used. Further investigation uncovered a secret message that ultimately led to the suspect’s hideout location, later confirmed using Google Maps.

**Learning Points**

  1. Utilized data carving techniques with Scalpel and Foremost to recover image files from a forensic drive image.
  2. Extracted EXIF metadata from images to reveal timestamp and GPS location data, linking images to specific times and places.
  3. Verified data integrity by hashing files using the MD5 hash to match evidence with known artifacts.
  4. Uncovered hidden messages through file extraction, adding value to forensic evidence and assisting in locating the suspect's hideout.
  5. Enhanced knowledge in forensic image processing and the practical application of digital forensic tools in criminal investigations.
